Dear Mr / Ms {{ $hoster_name }},
</div>

<br>

<div>
This mail confirms that you have made a reservation for a IRMA-meet
video exam with yourself as examiner. This meeting has the link:
</div>

<br>

<div>
<a href="{{ $invitation_link }}">{{ $invitation_link }}</a>
</div>

<br>

<div> 
This link remains valid for 24 hours after this moment. Anytime
during those 24 hours you can start the meeting by following this
link. You will then have to (again) login at irma-meet.nl, with your
academic personal data from SURFconext from your IRMA app, before the video meeting
actually starts. Your name and role at the academic instutition will then be visible to
the student.  
</div>

<br>

<div>
It is up to you to distribute the above meeting link to the student that
you wish to invite to the video exam --- together with its start
time and exam details, etc. You can pass on this link for instance via email or
messaging. When the student follows the link that you include, (s)he
will have to disclose his/her academic personal data from SURFconext too, via IRMA. The
disclosed student number and name of the student are visible during the meeting.
</div>

<br>

<div>
Please note:
<ul>
<li>When the meeting is
  finished, the host link expires. You can then create a new meeting,
  but you can not have two links/meeting reservations that are active
  at the same time.</li>
<li>It is advised to inform the student that they need to
  get the IRMA app first, and that they need to fill it with their academic personal data from SURFconext. 
  You can refer them to the website <a href="https://irma.app">https://irma.app</a> for
  more information.</li>

<div>
Enjoy your authenticated meeting!
