Dear Mr / Ms {{ $hoster_name }},
</div>

<br>

<div>
This mail confirms that you have made a reservation for a IRMA-meet
video exam with yourself as examiner. This meeting has the link:
</div>

<br>

<div>
<a href="{{ $invitation_link }}">{{ $invitation_link }}</a>
</div>

<br>

<div>

This link remains valid for 24 hours after this moment. Anytime during
those 24 hours you can start the meeting by following this link. You
will then have to (again) login as teacher at irma-meet.nl, with your
academic card from SURFconext from your IRMA app, before the video
meeting actually starts. Your name and email address will then be
visible to the student.

</div>

<br>
<div>
  {{ $invitation_note }}
</div>
<br>

<div>

It is up to you to inform the student about the start time and exam details, etc. When the student follows the link, he/she will have to make him/herself known, via IRMA, with: name, email adress, student number. These personal data will be visible during the meeting, so that you can be sure about the student's identity.

<br>

<div>
Please note:
<ul>
<li>When the meeting is
  finished, the host link expires. You can then create a new meeting,
  but you can not have two links/meeting reservations that are active
  at the same time.</li>

<li>It is advised to inform your students in advance that they need
  the IRMA app for these oral exams. Thus, students need to install the
  app first, register, and then load the academic card from
  SURFconext.  You can refer them to the websites <a
  href="https://irma.app">https://irma.app</a> and <a
  href="https://privacybydesign.foundation/issuance/surfnet/surfnet/">academic
  card</a> for more information.
</li>

Enjoy your authenticated meeting!
