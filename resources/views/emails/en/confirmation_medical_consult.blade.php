Dear Mr / Ms {{ $hoster_name }},
</div>

<br>

<div>
This mail confirms that you have made a reservation for a
IRMA-meet medical video consult with yourself as the medical
practicioner. This meeting has the link:
</div>

<br>

<div>
<a href="{{ $invitation_link }}">{{ $invitation_link }}</a>
</div>

<br>

<div> 

This link remains valid for 24 hours after this moment. Anytime during
those 24 hours you can start the meeting by following this link. You
will then have to (again) login as medical professional at
irma-meet.nl, with your medical registration number (AGB), name and
email address, from your IRMA app, before the video consult actually
starts. Your name, email and AGB-code can be seen by the patient
in the video meeting.

<div>

It is up to you to inform your patient about the start time and consult details, etc. When the patient follows the link, he/she will have to make him/herself known, via IRMA, with:
name, date of birth, gender and citizen registration number (BSN). These personal data will be visible during the meeting, so that you can be sure about the patient's identity.

</div>

<br>

<div>
Please note:
<ul>
<li>When the meeting is
  finished, the host link expires. You can then create a new meeting,
  but you can not have two links/meeting reservations that are active
  at the same time.
  </li>

<li>It is advised to inform your patients in advance that they need
  the IRMA app for these medical video consults. Thus, patients need
  to install the app first, register, and then load the citizen card
  (BRP).  You can refer them to the websites <a
  href="https://irma.app">https://irma.app</a> and <a
  href="https://services.nijmegen.nl/irma/gemeente/start">citizen
  card</a> for more information.
</li>

Enjoy your authenticated meeting!
