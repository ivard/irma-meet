Dear {{ $hoster_name }},
</div>

<br>

<div>
This mail confirms that you have made a reservation for a IRMA-meet
video call with yourself as host. This meeting has the link:
</div>

<br>

<div>
<a href="{{ $invitation_link }}">{{ $invitation_link }}</a>
</div>

<br>

<div> 
This link remains valid for 24 hours after this moment. Anytime
during those 24 hours you can start the meeting by following this
link. You will then have to (again) login at irma-meet.nl, with your
name and email address from your IRMA app, before the video meeting
actually starts. Your name and email address will then be visible to
everyone else in the meeting.  
</div>

<br>

<div>
It is up to you to distribute the above meeting link to people that
you wish to invite to the video meeting --- together with its start
time, agenda, etc. You can pass on this link for instance via email or
messaging. When the receiver follows the link that you include, (s)he
will have to disclose their name and email address too, via IRMA. The
disclosed name and email address of each participant are visible for
everyone in the meeting.
</div>

<br>

<div>
Please note:
<ul>
<li>The video meeting can last at most one hour. When this meeting is
  finished, the host link expires. You can then create a new meeting,
  but you can not have two links/meeting reservations that are active
  at the same time.</li>
<li>It is advised to inform the people that you invite that they need to
  get the IRMA app first, and that they need to fill it with at least
  their email address and name (from LinkedIn or from the Dutch civil
  registry BRP). You can refer them to the website <a href="https://irma.app">https://irma.app</a> for
  more information.</li>

<div>
Enjoy your authenticated meeting!
